# tesstrain-sanPlusMinus

This uses a custom version of [tesstrain](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesstrain) repo for Demo of PlusMinus training for Sanskrit using `san` as the START_MODEL. 

The ground-truth data is included as part of this repo. 

One of the changes is addition of a plot to visualize the CER from training iterations, checkpoints, evaluation test and validation test. See sample below.
